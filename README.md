# infovae-seminar

This repository accompanies our LMU seminar on InfoVAE and its extensions (see Zhao et al., 2019). It includes:

- **Experiment scripts** for InfoVAE and its variants, alternative divergences (MMD, Stein, Sinkhorn, Cramér, χ²), adaptive hyperparameter schedulers, and lightweight VAEs (Free‑Bits, BN‑VAE, ContrastiveAE).  
- **Evaluation notebooks** that reproduce metrics from the original paper—aggregate‑posterior alignment (RBF‑MMD), reconstruction error, semi‑supervised classification—and add training‑time analysis.  

See `InfoVAE.pdf` for the main paper and notebooks for code examples.
