# infovae-seminar

This repository accompanies our LMU seminar on InfoVAE and its extensions (see Zhao et al., 2019). It includes:

- **Code** for training and evaluating InfoVAE variants, alternative divergences (MMD, Stein, Sinkhorn, Cramér, χ²), adaptive hyperparameter schedulers, and lightweight VAEs (Free‑Bits, BN‑VAE, ContrastiveAE).  
- **Figures** demonstrating posterior–prior alignment (MMD), reconstruction quality, semi‑supervised error, and training time across latent dimensions.  

See `InfoVAE.pdf` for the main paper and ipynb notebooks for code examples.
